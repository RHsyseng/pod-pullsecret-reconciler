# In cases where the image must be mirrored instead of pulled directly from the registry,
# this app faces the same race condition it was built to mitigate. Since this image is mirrored
# directly from registry.redhat.io and contains no internal data, the "mirrorRBAC" option
# can be used to allow anonymous image pulls for the mirrored image. This allows pods to pull
# the image, even without a service account's image pull secret.
